# Bank Loan Domain Knowledge
## Overview
Bank loan is a financial tool that enables individuals and business to achieve their goals and manage financial needs. However, it's essential for borrowers to understand the terms, costs, and responsibilities associated wih loans to make informed(知情的) financial decisions.
## Key Metrics
**Loan Applications:** When individuals or business apply for loans, they submit detailed applications that include personal and financial information. This data is collected electronically or in paper form.

**Credit Reports:** Banks often access credit reports from credit bureaus(信用局) when assessing a borrowers's creditworthiness. These reports contain information about a person's credit history, existing loans, and payment behaviour.

**Internal Records:** Banks maintain internal records of loan transactions, including disbursements, repayments(还款), and loan status changes. These records are generated and stored in the bank' s database.

**Online Portals:** Many banks offer online platforms where borrowers can apply for loans, make payments, and access account information. Data from these portals is collected and stored for analysis.

**Third-party Data Sources:** Some banks use external data sources, such as income verification services, to gather additional information about borrowers.

## How to Grant a Loan
 1. **Loan Application:** The process begins when a customer submits a loan application to a bank or lending institution. This application can be submitted in person, online, or through other channels. 
2. **Application Review:** The lending institution reviews the loan application and collects necessary documentation, such as income  statements, credit reports, and identificaion documents.
3. **Identity Verification:** One of the initial checks is to verify the applicant's identity. This helps ensure that the applicant is who they claim to be and prevents identity theft.
4. **Credit Check:** A crucial step is to perform a credit check on the applicant. This involves accessing their credit report from credit bureaus. Lenders evaluate the applicant's credit history, credit score, and any past delinquencies or defaults.
5. **Income Verification:** Lenders assess the applicant's ability to repay the loan by verifying their income. This may involve reviewing pay stubs, tax returns, or other income documentation.
6. **Debot-to-Income Ratio(DTI) Check:** Lenders calculate the applicant's DTI, which is the ratio of their monthly debt payments to their monthly income. **A lower DTI indicates better repayment capacity.**
7. **Employment Verification:** Lenders may contact the applicant's employer to verify their employment status and length of employment. Stable employment history is often seen as a positive factor.
8. **Collateral(抵押品) Assessment:**  If the loan is secured by collateral, such as a home or a car, the lender evaluates the value and condition of the collateral.
9. **Risk Assessment:** Lenders assess the overall risk associated with the loan, This includes considering the applicant's risk, income stability, and the purpose of the loan. 
10. **Loan Approval or Denial:** Based on the information gathered and the risk assessment, the lender makes a decision to approve or deny the loan application. If approved, the lender determines the loan amount, interest rate, and terms.
11. **Loan Agreement:** If the loan is approved, the lender provides the applicant with a loan agreement that outlines the terms and conditions, including the interest rate, repayment schedule, and any fees.
12. **Disbursement of Funds:** Once the loan agreement is signed by both parties, the lender disburses the funds to the borrower. The borrower can use the funds for the specified purpose.
13. **Repayment：** The borrower is responsible for making regular loan paymentsas specified in the loan agreement. This includes repaying the principal amount along with interest.
14. **Ongoing Monitoring:** Lenders continue to monitor the loan throughout its term, including tracking payments, assessing the borrower's financial health, and managing any delinquencies or defaults.

## Why should we analyse Bank Loan Data
1. **Risk Assessment:** One of the primary purposes of analysing loan data is to assess the risk associated with lending to a particular individual or business. Banks use data to evaluate the creditworthiness of borrowers, predict default probabilities, and determine interest rates and lending terms.
2. **Decision-making:** Loan data analysis supports the decision-making process when evaluating loan applications. Banks use data-driven models and algorithms to make informed lending decisions, such as approving or denying loan requests.
3. **Portfolio Management:** Banks manage portfolios of loans, including mortages(抵押)
